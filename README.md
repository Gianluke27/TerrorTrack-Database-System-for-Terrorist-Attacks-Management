# TerrorTrack Database System for Terrorist Attacks Management
TerrorTrack is a comprehensive database system designed to store information related to terrorist attacks, featuring the following specifications:

Each terrorist attack is characterized by its date and time, location (country, region, city, etc.), geographical coordinates, the terrorist group or individual responsible, the number of terrorists involved, the type of attack, the weapon used, the target, the number of casualties (injured and deceased), a textual description of the attack, and possible motivations. Various types of terrorist attacks are accounted for, including assassination, kidnapping, bombings, armed assault, infrastructure attacks, sabotage, etc.

Some attack types involve the use of weapons. In such cases, details such as the type of weapon (firearm, vehicle, biological, chemical, radiological, nuclear, explosive, etc.), its name, and a description are recorded.

Regarding the target, it is essential to capture details such as target particulars (e.g., position, name, description, etc.) and the target type, which may include governmental, corporate, law enforcement, military, infrastructure, educational institutions, media, maritime, etc.

It's crucial to determine if the attack is part of a coordinated series and, if so, identify the other attacks involved. Additionally, it's valuable to establish if the attack is part of a historical sequence of attacks and document the temporal sequence.

Attacks may be carried out/claimed by a single terrorist or a terrorist group. For individual terrorists, available personal data, origin, and any affiliation with a terrorist group are recorded. For terrorist groups, details such as name, aliases, abbreviation (if applicable), primary origin, description, and group type (religious, political, etc.) are documented.

For concluded investigations, a detailed report containing investigation closure date, the organization responsible, a title, description, and attachments are available. For ongoing investigations, pertinent information such as investigating organization(s) with their respective details (abbreviation, name, country, etc.), investigation start date, etc., is recorded.
